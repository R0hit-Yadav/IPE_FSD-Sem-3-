<!-- Design a webpage for Learning Website that have multiple links for topics like Animation, Carousel, Collapse, Gradients – Linear, Radial, Conic etc. Once user 
click on particular link, example of that concept will be reflected as follow:
• For Animation, design one banner using any heading tag. That heading should move in counter-clockwise and complete its iteration then return back in clockwise on its starting position. Use blue text color. And effect should begin after 3
second of loading page. 
•    For carousel any 4 pictures move turn by turn.
• For collapse, design a page of E-newspaper having 3 articles by showing only titles initially. Script should enable reader to open a particular article by 
viewing and clicking its title and close it by clicking it again. If reader opens any other article, then previous article should disappear.
•    For gradients, clicking on each gradient effect demonstrate particular effect on entire web page. -->

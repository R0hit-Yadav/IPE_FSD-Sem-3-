<!-- Write a JS to design a signup form having fields like username, password, confirm password, gender, hobbies including various sports, address, states 
with country title, submit and reset button. Design decorative and attractive for by applying style according to your level of discretion. 
Textfields should be highlighted while gaining focus and entering data. They should return in original position, when data entering is over 
and user switches to other fields. Apply following validations:
• Username should accept alphanumeric characters only. 
• Password and confirm password must match. 
• Keep one checkbox having option “All”. If user selects this checkbox, then all remaining checkboxes should be checked. 
If any of the remaining checkbox deselects, then “All” should also get deselected. -->
